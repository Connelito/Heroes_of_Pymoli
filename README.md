After a lot of hard work in the data wrangling mines, I've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I will generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report will include each of the following:

### Player Count
  * Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)
  * Number of Unique Items
  * Average Purchase Price
